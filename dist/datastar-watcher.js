/**
 * DatastarWatcher — a Lit mixin that bridges a LitElement subclass into the
 * Datastar signal reactivity system.
 *
 * Features:
 *   - Auto-tracks exactly which Datastar signals are read during the host
 *     element's render cycle, and re-renders only when those signals change.
 *   - Exposes `this.dsRoot` — the Datastar global signal store proxy — for
 *     reading and writing signals directly in Lit templates.
 *   - Exposes `this.patch(obj)` and `this.setSignals(entries)` as write helpers.
 *   - Exposes `this.dsActions` — the global Datastar action registry — so the
 *     component can imperatively call actions registered anywhere on the page.
 *   - Exposes `this.addEffect(fn)` — creates a managed Datastar effect that is
 *     automatically disposed on disconnect and recreated on reconnect.
 *   - `@signalProperty` decorator — marks a getter as signal-derived, so that
 *     changes to any Datastar signal read inside it trigger a re-render even
 *     when the getter is not called from `render()`.
 *   - Morph awareness — when Datastar's "fat morph" patches new DOM content
 *     into the page, a MutationObserver on the host element's light DOM detects
 *     the change and calls `requestUpdate()`, keeping the component in sync.
 *     Controlled by `morphReactive` (default: true) and fully configurable via
 *     `morphObserverInit`. Use `protectFromMorph(el)` to add `data-ignore-morph`
 *     to elements that Datastar should leave untouched.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   import { LitElement, html } from 'lit'
 *   import { DatastarWatcher, signalProperty } from './datastar-watcher.js'
 *
 *   class MyCounter extends DatastarWatcher(LitElement) {
 *     render() {
 *       const count = this.dsRoot.count ?? 0
 *       return html`
 *         <button @click=${() => { this.dsRoot.count = count + 1 }}>
 *           Count: ${count}
 *         </button>
 *       `
 *     }
 *   }
 *   customElements.define('my-counter', MyCounter)
 *
 * Auto-tracking mechanism (mirrors @lit-labs/preact-signals exactly):
 *
 *   On each Lit update cycle, `performUpdate` (a protected method on
 *   ReactiveElement) is overridden to wrap `super.performUpdate()` inside a
 *   Datastar `effect()` call. Because Datastar's effect tracks all signal reads
 *   that occur during its synchronous execution, any signal read in `render()`
 *   is automatically subscribed. When any of those signals later change, the
 *   effect re-runs — at which point it calls `this.requestUpdate()` to enter
 *   Lit's own update queue, triggering a fresh render that re-subscribes to
 *   whatever signals the new render reads.
 *
 *   A fresh `effect()` is created on every render (the previous one is disposed
 *   first), so subscriptions always reflect the most recently rendered set of
 *   signals rather than a stale snapshot from a prior render.
 *
 *   On `disconnectedCallback`, the render effect and all managed effects are
 *   disposed. On `connectedCallback`, `requestUpdate()` is called to force a
 *   fresh render (and therefore a fresh render-effect subscription) on
 *   reconnection, and all managed effects registered via `addEffect` are
 *   recreated.
 *
 * addEffect:
 *
 *   `addEffect(fn)` creates a Datastar effect that runs immediately and is
 *   tracked independently of the render cycle. This is useful for side-effects
 *   that should respond to signal changes outside of `render()` — for example
 *   imperatively updating a third-party chart, syncing to localStorage, or
 *   logging. The effect function is stored so it can be recreated automatically
 *   on reconnection. `addEffect` returns the dispose function, which can be
 *   called early to unsubscribe before the element disconnects.
 *
 * @signalProperty:
 *
 *   A TC39 stage 3 getter decorator that wraps the getter in a managed effect.
 *   Any Datastar signals read by the getter are tracked; when they change, the
 *   element's `requestUpdate()` is called to schedule a re-render. This ensures
 *   the getter always reflects the latest signal state even when it is called
 *   from lifecycle hooks, event handlers, or computed expressions rather than
 *   directly from `render()`.
 *
 *   Example:
 *
 *     class MyProfile extends DatastarWatcher(LitElement) {
 *       @signalProperty
 *       get username() {
 *         return this.dsRoot.user?.name ?? 'Guest'
 *       }
 *
 *       render() {
 *         return html`<p>Hello, ${this.username}</p>`
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *   Because `username` is already tracked through the managed effect, it does
 *   not need to be read directly inside `render()` for changes to be noticed —
 *   though doing so is harmless (Datastar deduplicates subscriptions).
 *
 * Morph awareness:
 *
 *   Datastar's "fat morph" approach patches large HTML fragments from the
 *   server directly into the live DOM, morphing existing nodes in place rather
 *   than replacing them wholesale. For a Lit component this means the host
 *   element's light DOM children (slotted content), their descendant attributes,
 *   or their text content may be mutated externally — outside of Lit's own
 *   update cycle — and Lit would have no way to know.
 *
 *   The mixin wires up a `MutationObserver` on the host element that watches
 *   for any such external mutations and calls `requestUpdate()` in response,
 *   ensuring the component re-renders to reflect the new light DOM state.
 *
 *   Three protected members control this behaviour:
 *
 *   `morphReactive` (default: `true`) — set to `false` on any component that
 *   should not observe morph changes, e.g. one that renders only to shadow DOM
 *   and has no interest in its light DOM children.
 *
 *   `morphObserverInit` — the `MutationObserverInit` options passed to the
 *   observer. The default covers all mutation types that morphing can produce:
 *
 *     { childList: true, subtree: true, attributes: true, characterData: true }
 *
 *   Override to narrow the scope (e.g. `{ childList: true }`) if only coarse
 *   child add/remove events are needed and performance is a concern.
 *
 *   `protectFromMorph(el)` — adds the `data-ignore-morph` attribute to `el`,
 *   instructing Datastar's morphing algorithm to skip that element entirely.
 *   Useful when a component renders light DOM that must not be touched by the
 *   server (e.g. purely client-rendered interactive sub-trees).
 *
 *   The observer is automatically connected on `connectedCallback` and
 *   disconnected on `disconnectedCallback`, matching the effect lifecycle.
 *   Mutations caused by Lit's own update cycle are suppressed via an
 *   `#isUpdating` guard so they do not re-trigger the observer.
 *
 * Datastar version: 1.0.0-RC.8
 *
 * This file assumes Datastar is already loaded on the page and exposed via the
 * 'datastar' module specifier (e.g. through an import map).
